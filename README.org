* Yoshi theme

  My cat is named Yoshi and I was just working on a random new theme,
  which was =new-theme= for a while.  I couldn't think of a name so I
  named it after him.

** Installation

   Installation comes in two flavors.

*** Installation with ELPA

    To install Yoshi theme using the built-in Emacs package manager
    you should have [[https://marmalade-repo.org/][Marmalade]] in your =package-archives= list. When
    that's ready you can =M-x list-packages=, find =yoshi-theme=, press =i=
    and =x= and you're done.

*** Installation from git

    To use a version from the latest git checkout you should clone the
    repository and then add the directory to your
    =custom-theme-load-path=.

    In a shell execute:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cd ~/
    git clone git://github.com/ryuslash/yoshi-theme.git
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Then add to your =~/.emacs.d/init.el=:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path (expand-file-name "~/yoshi-theme"))
    #+END_SRC

** Enabling Yoshi theme

   Once you've installed Yoshi theme you can either use =M-x
   load-theme= to enable it interactively for the current session, or
   put the following in your =~/.emacs.d/init.el=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (load-theme 'yoshi :no-confirm)
   #+END_SRC
