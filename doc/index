# Yoshi theme

An [Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/) theme named after my cat.
He doesn't actually look anything like this theme!  But I needed a
name.

## Requirements

* Emacs 24 or newer

## Installation

Place `yoshi-theme.el` in your `custom-theme-load-path` and just call:

    (load-theme 'yoshi)
